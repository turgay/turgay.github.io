Hi there,

It has been 5 years since I blogged last time in [my Wordpress blog](https://turgaykivrak.wordpress.com/). Many things have changed in the technologies I work with and many new things arosen to shared. I still continue getting hands dirty on development. 
I had times to coach teams to improve process and gain development skills as well as do development. I have move completed remote work and have been working more than 2 years remotely. It is a great experience and I like it from many perspectives. Of course, it come with its own advantages and disadvanteges but overall I am much happier. As a nature of my current work, I have more technical things and thoughts to share with the world but also less time to write them. However, I have decided to blog more to share my thoughts, findings and the solutions so that maybe I can make more contrubiton and make someone other peoples life a bit easier

All the best and happy coding
